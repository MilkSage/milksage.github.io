  # Lina Reid

  <p>Hi! I'm Lina-- others may know me informally as Midna. I'm a concept artist whose passion is character and creature design! These past years have been spent honing my craft by doing daily practices, taking freelance commission work from clients both online and in person, and spending countless hours building whole worlds for my characters and creatures to reside in.</p>
  <p>Aside from being a dedicated artist, I am also a huge nerd. I love cartoons, comics, writing, world building, video games, furry, movies (especially horror!), sci-fi, and probably a ton of things I'm forgetting. Being passionate about a lot of things has created a deep pool for me to take inspiration from. I've even been fortunate enough to bring some of my wonderful creations (and other people's) to life in the form of costumes, and hopefully, eventually, in the form of my own video games.</p>

projects:
- {name: 'Elliot Reference Sheet (Full) 2017', category: 'characters', folder: 'elliot', description: 'A reference sheet for Elliot Richards, the player character for a personal horror project that is underway. He&#39;s a fiesty, adventurous teenaged boy who will need to fight to survive. Reference features color swatches, expressions, and basic information for Elliot.'}
- {name: 'Exterior - Giovanni&#39;s', category: 'illustrations', folder: 'env2', description: 'Gritty section of a city, back door to some grody bar/club called Giovanni&#39;s. My imagining was something mafia related, and therefore the building may be a little underground.'}
- {name: 'Exterior - Ocean', category: 'illustrations', folder: 'env1', description: 'Something still in the works, inspired by Wind Waker, and Breath of the Wild-- both beautiful Legend of Zelda games.'}
- {name: 'Bunko', category: 'characters', folder: 'bunko', description: 'Reference sheet for a personal character, Bunko. Bunko is a Japanese fox demon known as a "kitsune", which are often known to play tricks and be very mischievous. Bunko got his name from the English word "bunco", which is a type of confidence trick-- an attempt to defraud someone after first allowing them to gain their confidence. Bunko is known to steal the life orbs of other Kitsune after winning rigged games that he sets up for them.'}
- {name: 'Bates Ref 2017', category: 'characters', folder: 'bates2', description: 'I started working on Bates in 2015, and figured it was time he got a full reference sheet. He is a cartoon character brought to life by scientists, who perhaps misunderstood the violent nature of cartoons upon doing so. What may be funny to a cartoon, and capable of a cartoon, may not translate well to real life...Bates is the main antagonist of a personal horror project I am currently working on; He is a apathetic, extremely intelligent monster who traps victims for his own playtime.'}
- {name: 'Bates Head', category: 'sketches', folder: 'bates', description: 'Turn-around reference for Bates&#39; head, as he has some odd shapes and atypical anatomy due to his being a cartoon brought to life.'}
